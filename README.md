# Maryland-Crime-Trend-Analysis
We utilize data mining methodology to perform an exploratory data analysis on Maryland's crime rate, which has a higher violent crime rate (4.7) than the national average (3.7). The goal is to identify 1032 rows and classify crime patterns, crime based on locations and figure out which of Maryland's counties falls into the highest crime rate categories. The first thing that matters most is the safety. Given that Maryland is known for its violence, predicting crime will help in demonstrating which county has the highest risk factor. Our motive is to raise consciousness among people about the factors that cause unsafe behaviour. Analysis of crime can be provided to Police department which will help them increase the security or avoid crimes from happening. By understanding the patterns of criminal behaviour, many criminal investigations can be solved.
